## Some Stuff About Me
  Coding is a passion of mine, after completing 13 weeks of training at [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/). I had a great time there, I'd learned a lot; the most important thing I'd learned was what my favorite coding language would be.
  During my time there I'd learned that JavaScript was my favorite of them all. I'd learned the fundamentals of Web Development (HTML & CSS),JavaScript, Python, and Java (Which is the absolute worst) but nothing compared to JavaScript. And ReactJS is probably one of my greatest strong suits.
